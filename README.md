# Landing Page assignmetn for The Odin Project

This is part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. At the end of the CSS section, I have to build my own landing page.

I will be making updates to the README.md file to try and document my progress beyond just making git commits.

- June 29, 2022 - Added skeleton HTML and some experimental CSS.
- August 8, 2022 - Decided to re-do the whole thing because I know better now.
