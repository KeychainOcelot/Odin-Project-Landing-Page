# Landing Page for The Odin Project

This is part of The Odin Project's Foundations course. At the end of the CSS section, I have to build my own landing page.

I will be making updates to the README.md file to try and document my progress beyond just making git commits.

June 29, 2022 - Added skeleton HTML and some experimental CSS.
